This project is to showcase HTML markup knowledge

I will be working with raw text in order to learn how/when/where to apply
appropriate HTML markups.

1.) I created the homepage for the Bistro where everything will be linked, using a simple stylesheet directly coded into the head of the document for a quick presentation.

I also added a logo and plan to create links to different pages in the future.

2.) I created a News page where I have marked up proper HTML tags including header, footer, articles with appropriatly id'd sections, date/time, and div.

3.) Currently adding a Gallery of pictures of food that link to individual pages with large single pictures. These pages link back to the main gallery using link tags.

4.) Updated the main page with an SVG image for the logo.

Added a footer with social media icons non-interactive.
