This project is to showcase HTML markup knowledge

I will be working with raw text in order to learn how/when/where to apply
appropriate HTML markups.

1.) I created the homepage for the Bistro where everything will be linked, using a simple stylesheet directly coded into the head of the document for a quick presentation.

I also added a logo and plan to create links to different pages in the future.

2.)I created a News page where I have marked up proper HTML tags including header, footer, articles with appropriatly id'd sections, date/time, and div.
